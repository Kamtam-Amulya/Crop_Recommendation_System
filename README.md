# Crops-Classification-With-Recommendation-System-Machine-Learning

This project is a machine learning-based Crop Classification and Recommendation System. It uses a trained model to predict the best crop to cultivate based on various environmental and soil parameters such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall. The system is built using Flask and provides a user-friendly web interface for farmers and agricultural professionals to input their data and receive crop recommendations.
